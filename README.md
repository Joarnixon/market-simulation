# A currently raw project made for fun.

## Maybe not just for fun, it actually boosts my knowledge in machine learning and is very scalable to another AI and algorithms application. Also my first experience with git branches.

## Like how about make an RL agents in this environment? 

## Or an AI for stock trading, fast approximate segmentation, optimization for larger scales and so on. 

## How about using the essentials of people connections? People united by the family bonds may share their loyalty, memory with each other - a graph algorithms will be in use.

### In the end, I want to create a game based on this economic engine. The game would focus on medieval politics and conquests while balancing with harsh economics. In-town businessmen can gain political power over you as they grow in wealth and production. The city-building aspect would be minimized, as people and businessmen will build buildings to achieve prosperity on their own, but you can interfere and build what you need the most or capture with force. Additionally, the game will have a fantasy setting with powerful adventurer guilds to accomplish guild missions.
