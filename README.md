# A currently raw project made for fun.

## Maybe not just for fun, it actually boosts my knowledge in machine learning and is very scalable to another AI and algorithms application.

## Like how about make an RL agents in this environment? 

## Or an AI for stock trading, fast approximate segmentation, optimization for larger scales and so on. 

## How about using the essentials of people connections? People united by the family bonds may share their loyalty, memory with each other - a graph algorithms will be in use.

### At the end I want to create a game based on this economics engine. Game would focus on medieval politics and conquers whilst balancing with harsh economics, in-town buisnessmens which can gain political power over you as they grow in wealth and production amounts. City-building aspect would be minimized as people and buisnessmens will build buildings to achieve prosperity on their own except you can interfere and build what you need the most. Also a fantasy setting with powerful avanturist guilds to accomplish the guild missions.
