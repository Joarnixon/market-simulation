# Currently a raw project made for fun.

## Maybe not just for fun, it actually boosts my knowledge in machine learning, requires proving math theorems for better performance, and is very scalable to AI and algorithms application. Also, a good experience with git branches.

## Now, how about infusing this environment with RL agents? I personally desire to apply genetic algorithms there, which will benefit the social aspect of the game. The possibilities stretch as far as the mind can wander. Just for a quick example: fast approximate segmentation, similarity search, optimization at grander scales, and GPU asynchronization.

## How about leveraging the essence of human connections? I envision a world where families share memories, opinions, and some people influence other people
## Sellers that might get united by common goals will tend to form lobbies. This all will be made with graph algorithms.

## In the end, I want to create a game based on this economic engine. A game not centered around city-building, but one where the economy and people breathe life into the city with its chaos and unpredictability and still with order. Where people and sellers are the architects of prosperity, and the city expands organically, reflecting the vibrant economy at its core. And many other features that will suit this game.
