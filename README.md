# Currently a raw project made for fun.

## Maybe not just for fun, it actually boosts my knowledge in machine learning and is very scalable to another AI and algorithms application. Also experience with git branches and OOP.

### How about make an RL agents in this environment? Neural network doesn't suite this complex environment and perform bad. Regressions show better results.

### Fast approximate segmentation, similiarity search, optimization for larger scales, asynchronization, and so on. 

### How about using the essentials of people connections? People united by the family bonds may share their loyalty, memory with each other, sellers would tend to form a lobby - a graph algorithms will be in use.

### In the end, I want to create a game based on this economic engine. The city-building aspect would be minimized, as people and sellers will build economy to achieve prosperity on their own and city will grow in size. And many other features that will suite this game.
